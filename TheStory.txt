The spoon was a little bit down, 
All he did was sit in his dressing gown, 
Thinking too much about the past, 
To move he couldn't be asked, 
He wanted to become brave, 
So he meditated in a cave, 
Pondered on the questions of life, 
And decided he wanted to find a wife, 
He took the train to Cork, 
And found a fine looking fork, 
He proposed to her there on the spot, 
And before he knew it they'd tied the knot, 
The spoon was so happy with his wife, 
But she left him to be with a knife, 
The spoon again put on his dressing gown, 
And spent his final years with a permanent frown
